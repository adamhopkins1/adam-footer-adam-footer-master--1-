                    <p className="description">Artificial intelligence has come a long way since the 1950s, and it has taken on an impressive array of tasks. It can solve math problems, detect natural disasters, identify different living organisms, pilot ships and more. But for tech giants like Google and Meta, one of their holy grails is formulating an AI that can understand language the way that humans do (a quest that at times, comes with its own set of conflicts).</p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/google-ai-wordcraft/" className="action"><i className="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>

                    <p className="description">While many people see autonomous vehicles as the solution to reduce congestion, traffic accidents and greenhouse gas emissions, others believe this technology will result in a loss of jobs in many sectors. Taking a holistic view on this technology, by taking both positive and negative impacts into account and converting them into societal costs and benefits, can result in new insights..</p><a href="https://www.compact.nl/en/articles/the-economic-and-social-impacts-of-fully-autonomous-vehicles/" className="action"><i className="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>

                    <p className="description">Sociological interest in studying different aspects of AI and society has increased as AI systems have been commercialized, and AI technologies have become more pervasive in different domains. Research literature has exploded as a consequence. Navigating this vast amount of literature is challenging for those who just entered the field of the sociology of AI. </p><a href="https://montrealethics.ai/sociological-perspectives-on-artificial-intelligence-a-typological-reading/" className="action"><i className="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>

                    <p className="description">The digitization of music has changed how we consume, produce, and distribute music. In this paper, we explore the effects of digitization and streaming on the globalization of popular music. While some argue that digitization has led to more diverse cultural markets, others consider that the increasing accessibility to international music would result in a globalized market where a few artists garner all the attention.</p><a href="#" className="action"><i className="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>

That decline – 77.0 to 76.1 years – took U.S. life expectancy at birth to its lowest level since 1996. The 0.9 year drop in life expectancy in 2021, along with a 1.8 year drop in 2020, was the biggest two-year decline in life expectancy since 1921-1923.</p><a href="#" className="action"><i className="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>
